    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the two code cells below to start up the drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have five drawing modes:\n",
    "- sketch (free hand drawing)\n",
    "- line\n",
    "- rectangle\n",
    "- circle\n",
    "- ellipse\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a choice of filled/not-filled, line colour, and line width. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also have buttons for\n",
    "- Undo, to undo the last drawing command\n",
    "- Erase, to erase the drawing layer\n",
    "- Save, to save the drawing to a file (my_file.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Save\" is a little flakey. You might need to save two or three times to get everything to save. Check your saved file, to see that it is there and has a drawing in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "We made the code the same for the different modes, to keep things simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "However,  switch statement is needed in the Mouse Move event, as each drawing mode does something different here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In version 4, we clean up the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To do:\n",
    "- Fix the save command. It is flakey.\n",
    "- Add an option to change the name of file to save as.\n",
    "- Add a load button, to load in a new background image. "
